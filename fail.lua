-- Fail(0, jid, worker, group, message, now, [data])
-- -------------------------------------------------
-- Mark the particular job as failed, with the provided group, and a more
-- specific message. By `group`, we mean some phrase that might be one of
-- several categorical modes of failure. The `message` is something more
-- job-specific, like perhaps a traceback.
-- 
-- This method should __not__ be used to note that a job has been dropped or
-- has failed in a transient way. This method __should__ be used to note that
-- a job has something really wrong with it that must be remedied.
-- 
-- The motivation behind the `group` is so that similar errors can be grouped
-- together. Optionally, updated data can be provided for the job. A job in
-- any state can be marked as failed. If it has been given to a worker as a 
-- job, then its subsequent requests to heartbeat or complete that job will
-- fail. Failed jobs are kept until they are canceled or completed.
--
-- __Returns__ the id of the failed job if successful, or `False` on failure.
--
-- Args:
--    1) jid
--    2) worker
--    3) group
--    4) message
--    5) the current time
--    6) [data]
